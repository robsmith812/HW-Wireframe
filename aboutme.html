                    <p class="border1">Born and raised in Sacramento, CA, I spent my childhood in different areas including:
                        Meadowview and Greenhaven, with a mojority of my youth spent in South Sacramento.  At the 
                        age of 17, I moved to San Francisco to attend University of San Francisco for undergrad. 
                        After obtaining my Bachelors Degree, I moved to San Leandro for around 3 years for work.
                        I then got a job in Southern California which had me move to San Diego, my favoirte city
                        that I have lived in. After 2 years, I moved back to the Bay Area to live in Santa Clara 
                        while working on my Master's Degree at University of San Francisco. Shortly after completeing
                        the 2 year program, I got a job at Sonoma State University, where I am still currently
                        employed as a Campus Life Advisor in Student Involvement. I have been living in the North Bay
                        for 5 years now, with my next journey being gaining a knowledge base in web development.

                <h2 class="title">Hobbies</h2>

                <h3 class="center">Soccer</h3>
                    <p class="border1">The sport of soccer was truly my first love. I started playing at the age of 5 with my dad
                        being my coach. I quickly moved on to playing on competitive youth teams which had my family
                        and I traveling almost every weekend. I also had the opportunity to tryout and play for 
                        Northern California State Team, which lead me to a tryout for the Western United States team,
                        that I did not make. However, these experiences developed me enough to be a member of the 
                        NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Team at University of San Francisco. I still enjoy playing and 
                        coaching to this day.

                <h3 class="center">Gamer</h3>
                    <p class="border1">I was always faced with the decision to practice my craft of soccer or put in a couple more
                        hours in the game I was currently playing. Video games have given me a community and brought
                        me to meet my closest friends. Overtime, I have come to believe that games offer much more 
                        than satisfaction for completing challenges, but they truly offer a set a transferrable skills
                        that can be applied in serveral different settings. Further, when disected, they offer deep 
                        commentary on society touching on topics like: race, gender roles, sexual orientation, and 
                        socio-economic status. Some of my favorite series include: Final Fantasy, Fallout, Bioshock,
                        and Dark Souls.
                    </p>
                
                <h3 class="center">Travel & Food</h3>
                    <p class="border1">Travel is something that I alwasy enjoy. I am thankful for the privelage to be able
                        to have the opportunity to visit other countries. And what is a trip abroad without
                        tasting some delious food. Some of my favorite places that I have been are London
                        (full English breakfast is bomb),Barcelona (make a trip to Mercado de La Boqueria
                        for a wide range of tasting), and Paris (I never passed up on a croque madame).
                    </p>

                <h3 class="center">Family & Friends</h3>
                    <p class="border1">These relationships are very important to me. Spending time with those are close to
                        me is something I truly enojy. The connections that are built and the stories that 
                        come from these expereinces are those that we always remember and continue to talk 
                        about today.
